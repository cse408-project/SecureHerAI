# OTP Input Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a beautiful 6-box OTP (One-Time Password) input component for the verify-login screen using `react-native-otp-entry`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package

- Added `react-native-otp-entry` (v1.8.5) for professional OTP input functionality

### 2. Created OTPInput Component (`components/OTPInput.tsx`)

- **Features:**

  - 6 individual input boxes with professional styling
  - Brand color theming (`#67082F` for focus color)
  - Customizable number of digits (default: 6)
  - Auto-focus support
  - Disabled state support
  - Beautiful animations and focus states
  - Shadow effects and rounded corners
  - Responsive design

- **Styling:**
  - White background with gray borders
  - Brand color (`#67082F`) when focused
  - Light brand background (`#FFF7F5`) when focused
  - 48x56px boxes with 6px horizontal margin
  - 12px border radius for modern look
  - Subtle shadow effects

### 3. Updated Verify Login Screen (`app/(auth)/verify-login.tsx`)

- Replaced the old single TextInput with the new OTPInput component
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Improved user experience with individual digit boxes
- Consistent with modern mobile app standards

## Usage

```tsx
<OTPInput
  label="Verification Code"
  onTextChange={setCode}
  numberOfDigits={6}
  autoFocus={false}
  disabled={isVerifying}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can see exactly how many digits they've entered
2. **Professional Look**: Matches industry standards for OTP input
3. **Accessibility**: Better focus management and visual feedback
4. **Brand Consistency**: Uses SecureHerAI brand colors
5. **Mobile Optimized**: Works well on both iOS and Android
6. **Web Compatible**: Also works well in web environments

## Technical Details

- Uses `react-native-otp-entry` library for cross-platform compatibility
- Maintains existing form validation and submission logic
- No breaking changes to existing API calls
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Styled with NativeWind/Tailwind classes
- Consistent with the rest of the app's design system

The implementation provides a much more professional and user-friendly experience for entering verification codes while maintaining all existing functionality.
