# Report System Navigation Cleanup - Summary

## Problem Solved
There was redundancy between:
- `app/(tabs)/reports.tsx` - The main reports tab screen
- `app/reports/` directory - Redundant screens with similar functionality

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed redundant directory**: Deleted `app/reports/` entirely
2. **Created canonical screens** in main app directory:
   - `app/report-submit.tsx` - Submit new reports
   - `app/report-details.tsx` - View and edit report details  
   - `app/report-evidence.tsx` - Upload evidence to reports

3. **Updated all navigation** to use canonical paths:
   - Reports tab: `router.push("/report-details?id=${reportId}")`
   - Home quick action: `router.push("/report-submit")`
   - Evidence upload: `router.push("/report-evidence?reportId=${reportId}")`

## Final Structure
```
app/
├── (tabs)/
│   ├── reports.tsx      # Main reports tab - entry point
│   └── index.tsx        # Home with "Report Incident" quick action
├── report-submit.tsx    # Canonical submit screen (modal)
├── report-details.tsx   # Canonical details screen
├── report-evidence.tsx  # Canonical evidence screen (modal)
└── _layout.tsx         # Routes configured for canonical screens
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No redundancy**: Single source of truth for each screen
- ✅ **Clear navigation**: All routes point to canonical screens
- ✅ **Simplified maintenance**: No duplicate code to maintain
- ✅ **Better UX**: Consistent navigation patterns
- ✅ **Proper routing**: Modal and detail presentations configured correctly

## Navigation Flow
1. **Entry Points**:
   - Home → "Report Incident" → `/report-submit`
   - Reports Tab → "Submit New Report" → `/report-submit`
   - Reports Tab → Tap Report Card → `/report-details`

2. **Secondary Actions**:
   - Report Details → "Upload Evidence" → `/report-evidence`
   - All screens properly handle back navigation

All screens are now properly integrated with no compilation errors and clean navigation paths.
