# SecureHer AI - Implementation Summary

## What was copied from `app` to `secureherai-app`:

### 1. **Authentication System**

- **Login Screen** (`app/login.tsx`): Complete login functionality with email/password authentication
- **Signup Screen** (`app/signup.tsx`): User registration with validation
- **AuthService** (`services/AuthService.ts`): API calls for login, register, logout, and auth status checking

### 2. **Home Screen**

- **Main Dashboard** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):
  - Large SOS button (3-second press trigger)
  - Report submission navigation
  - Notification badge
  - Logout functionality
  - Beautiful UI with SecureHer AI color scheme

### 3. **Report Submission**

- **Full Report Form** (`app/report-submission.tsx`):
  - Incident type selection (harassment, theft, assault, other)
  - Location coordinates input
  - Incident time tracking
  - Description field
  - Visibility settings (public, officials only, private)
  - Anonymous submission option
  - Evidence URL support

### 4. **Secondary Features**

- **Reports/Menu Screen** (`app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`):
  - Quick access cards for various features
  - Create Report shortcut
  - My Reports placeholder
  - Emergency Contacts placeholder
  - Settings placeholder
  - Safety tips section

### 5. **Configuration**

- **API Configuration** (`config/index.ts`): Backend API URL configuration
- **Navigation Setup**: File-based routing adapted for Expo Router
- **Authentication Flow**: Automatic login/logout state management

## Key Adaptations Made:

### From React Navigation to Expo Router:

- Changed from stack navigator to file-based routing
- Updated navigation calls to use `router.push()` and `router.replace()`
- Adapted screen imports and exports

### Expo-Specific Features:

- Used `@expo/vector-icons` instead of `react-native-vector-icons`
- Installed AsyncStorage with `npx expo install`
- Updated imports to work with Expo's module resolution

### UI Improvements:

- Maintained the original SecureHer AI color scheme (#4d0000, #ffecd1, #7f2b1c)
- Added logout functionality to home screen
- Created card-based layout for secondary features
- Added proper TypeScript types and error handling

## File Structure in `secureherai-app`:

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx          # Root layout with auth flow
├── login.tsx            # Login screen
├── signup.tsx           # Signup screen
├── report-submission.tsx # Report form
└── (tabs)/
    ├── _layout.tsx      # Tab layout
    ├── index.tsx        # Home screen with SOS
    └── explore.tsx      # Reports & menu screen

└── AuthService.ts       # Authentication API calls

config/

```

## Ready to Test:

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing. All core functionality from the original `app` folder has been successfully ported to the `secureherai-app` Expo structure, with proper adaptations for the different navigation system and Expo-specific features.

To run: `cd secureherai-app && npm start`
