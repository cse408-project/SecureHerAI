Merge Conflict:
# 1. Make sure you're on your branch and changes are committed
git status  # Verify your working directory is clean

# 2. Fetch the latest changes without merging
git fetch origin

# 3. Merge the remote branch into your local branch
git merge origin/main  # Replace 'main' with the branch you're merging from

# 4. If there are conflicts, Git will tell you
# Open each conflicted file and resolve the conflicts
# Look for markers like <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>>

# 5. After resolving all conflicts, add the resolved files
git add .  # Or add each file individually

# 6. Create a merge commit
git commit -m "Merge remote branch and resolve conflicts"

# 7. Push your changes to the remote repository
