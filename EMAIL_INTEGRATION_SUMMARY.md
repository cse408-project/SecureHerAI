   - Clear action instructions for immediate response
   - Includes all emergency details (time, location, message)

2. **`sendNotificationEmail()`** - General notification email for any notification type
   - Uses existing email header/footer styling
   - Converts plain text to HTML formatting
   - Consistent branding with other SecureHerAI emails

## üîÑ Notification Flow Integration

### SOS Alert Triggered ‚Üí Automatic Email Sending

When an SOS alert is triggered via:

- **Voice command** (`/api/sos/voice-command`)
- **Text command** (`/api/sos/text-command`)
- **File upload** (existing voice processing)

The system now automatically:

1. **Creates the alert** in the database
2. **Finds trusted contacts** for the user
3. **Sends professional HTML emails** to each trusted contact with their email address
4. **Creates in-app notifications** for nearest 2 responders
5. **Logs all activities** for monitoring and debugging

### General Notifications ‚Üí Email Support

For any notification created with `channel: EMAIL` or `channel: BOTH`:

1. **Retrieves user's email** from the database
2. **Sends formatted HTML email** using the notification title and message
3. **Marks notification as sent** upon successful delivery
4. **Handles failures gracefully** and marks as failed if email sending fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### NotificationService Changes

- **Added UserRepository dependency** to retrieve user email addresses
- **Updated `sendEmergencyEmailToContact()`** to use EmailService properly
- **Enhanced `sendNotificationAsync()`** to send actual emails
- **Added proper error handling** for email sending failures

### EmailService Integration

- **Reuses existing SMTP configuration** from your application.properties
- **Maintains consistent branding** with existing SecureHerAI emails
- **Professional HTML formatting** with proper error handling
- **Logging integration** for monitoring email delivery

## üì± Real-World Usage

### Example Emergency Scenario

1. **User triggers SOS alert**:

   ```http
   POST /api/sos/voice-command
   {
     "audioUrl": "...",
     "location": {
       "latitude": 23.8103,
       "longitude": 90.4125,
       "address": "Dhaka University Campus"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **System automatically sends emails** to trusted contacts like:

   ```
   To: sister@gmail.com
   Subject: üö® EMERGENCY ALERT - Immediate Attention Required

   [Professional HTML email with emergency details and action instructions]
   ```

3. **Trusted contacts receive immediate notification** with all necessary information to respond

### Example General Notification

1. **Create notification with email**:

   ```http
   POST /api/notifications/create
   {
     "userId": "...",
     "type": "ARE_YOU_SAFE",
     "channel": "BOTH",
     "title": "üîç Safety Check",
     "message": "Are you safe? Your emergency alert is still active..."
   }
   ```

2. **User receives both**:
   - In-app notification (for mobile app)
   - Professional HTML email (to their registered email address)

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### SMTP Settings (Already Configured)

Your existing `application.properties` should have:

```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

### No Additional Configuration Needed

The integration uses your existing email configuration, so no additional setup is required.

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Email Delivery Tracking

- **Success logs**: "Emergency email sent to trusted contact: name (email@domain.com)"
- **Failure logs**: "Failed to send emergency email to trusted contact: name (email@domain.com)"
- **Notification emails**: "Email notification sent for notification: {id}"

### Error Handling
