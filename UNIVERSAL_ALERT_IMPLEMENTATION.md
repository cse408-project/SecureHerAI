# Universal Alert System Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Universal Alert Manager (`utils/alertManager.tsx`)

- Created a comprehensive alert system that handles both web and native platforms automatically
- Provides both Context-based (`useAlert` hook) and direct function (`showAlert`) APIs
- Automatically detects platform and uses appropriate alert mechanism:
  - **Web**: Custom modal-based alert using the existing `WebAlert` component
  - **Native**: React Native's built-in `Alert.alert`

### 2. Integration with App Root Layout

- Added `AlertProvider` to the root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- Set up global alert function for use outside of React components
- Ensured alert system is available throughout the entire app

### 3. Replaced Platform-Specific Alert Code

Updated all files to use the universal `showAlert` function instead of:

- Direct `Alert.alert` calls
- Platform-specific conditionals (`if (Platform.OS === "web")`)
- Custom WebAlert state management

### Files Updated:

- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Settings screen with logout confirmation
- `app/(auth)/index.tsx` - Login screen
- `app/(auth)/reset-password.tsx` - Password reset screen
- `app/(auth)/verify-login.tsx` - Login verification screen
- `app/(auth)/forgot-password.tsx` - Forgot password screen
- `app/(auth)/complete-profile.tsx` - Profile completion screen
- `app/(tabs)/contacts-new.tsx` - New contact screen

### 4. API Consistency

All alert calls now use the same simple API:

```typescript
showAlert(title: string, message: string, buttons: AlertButton[])
```

Where `AlertButton` supports:

- `text: string` - Button label
- `onPress?: () => void` - Button action (optional)
- `style?: 'default' | 'cancel' | 'destructive'` - Button styling

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No More Platform Checks**: Eliminated all `if (Platform.OS === "web")` conditionals from business logic
2. **Single API**: One consistent function for all alert needs across the entire app
3. **Automatic Platform Handling**: The alert system automatically chooses the right implementation
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed state management for web alerts from individual components
5. **Better UX**: Consistent alert behavior across all platforms
6. **Maintainable**: Changes to alert styling/behavior only need to be made in one place

## Usage Examples

### Simple Alert

```typescript
showAlert("Error", "Something went wrong", [{ text: "OK" }]);
```

### Confirmation Dialog

```typescript
showAlert("Logout", "Are you sure you want to logout?", [
  { text: "Cancel", style: "cancel" },
  { text: "Logout", style: "destructive", onPress: handleLogout },
]);
```

### Success Message with Action

```typescript
showAlert("Success", "Profile updated successfully!", [
  { text: "OK", onPress: () => router.push("/profile") },
]);
```

## Technical Implementation

The system provides three ways to use alerts:

1. **Hook-based (in React components)**:

   ```typescript
   const { showAlert } = useAlert();
   ```

2. **Direct import (anywhere)**:

   ```typescript
   import { showAlert } from "../utils/alertManager";
   ```

3. **Fallback support**: If the provider is not available, it falls back to basic implementations

The universal alert system is now fully implemented and all platform-specific alert code has been eliminated from the application!
