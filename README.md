## ⚙️ Setup & Development

### Backend (API)

1. **Prerequisites:** Java 17+, Maven 3.6+, PostgreSQL 12+
2. **Environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in secrets (see below)
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
3. **Run Locally:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
   ```
   API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Mobile App

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd secureherai-app
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   - Web: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
   - Mobile: Scan QR with Expo Go

---

## 🧪 Testing

- **API:** Use HTTP files in `secureherai-api/endpoints/` (e.g., `auth_test.http`, `con_not_test.http`)
- **Mobile:** Use Expo Go, web browser, or emulators.
- **Test Coverage:** All major modules (auth, contacts, notifications, alerts) have comprehensive tests and error handling for implemented features.

---

## 🔒 Security

- JWT authentication and role-based access
- Input validation (phone, email, required fields)
- Proper error codes and messages
- User isolation for sensitive data (contacts, preferences)
- Secure environment variable management

---

## 📲 Deployment & CI/CD

### GitHub Actions (API → Azure)

- **Deploys API** to Azure VM on push to `main`
- **Steps:** Docker build, SSH to VM, deploy with Docker Compose, health checks
- **Secrets:** Managed via GitHub repository secrets (Azure VM, mail, OAuth, etc.)

### EAS (Expo Application Services)

- **Workflows:** `secureherai-app/.eas/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Builds:** Android APK, deploys web on push to `main`
- **Config:** `secureherai-app/eas.json` for build profiles
- **Web App:** [https://secureherai.expo.app/](https://secureherai.expo.app/)

### Namecheap DNS
