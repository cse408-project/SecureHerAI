# Incident Report Module Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a complete incident reporting system for the SecureHerAI application based on the provided database schema and following the existing code patterns in the project.

## Files Created

### 1. Entity Layer
- **`IncidentReport.java`** - JPA entity representing the incident_reports table
  - Maps to all fields in the schema including location, timestamps, visibility settings
  - Includes proper validation annotations and constructors
  - Follows the same patterns as other entities in the project

### 2. Repository Layer  
- **`IncidentReportRepository.java`** - Data access layer
  - Extends JpaRepository for basic CRUD operations
  - Custom queries for user-specific reports, public reports, geographical searches
  - Authorization-aware queries (by user ID, visibility filtering)

### 3. DTO Layer
- **`ReportRequest.java`** - Request DTOs for all operations
  - `SubmitReport` - Submit new incident reports with validation
  - `UploadEvidence` - Upload evidence files to existing reports
  - `UpdateVisibility` - Change report visibility settings
  - Includes nested `Location` class for coordinates

- **`ReportResponse.java`** - Response DTOs for all operations
  - `GenericResponse` - Standard success/error responses
  - `UserReportsResponse` - List of user's reports
  - `ReportDetailsResponse` - Full report details
  - `ReportSummary` & `ReportDetails` - Data transfer objects
  - `LocationInfo` - Location information for responses

### 4. Service Layer
- **`ReportService.java`** - Business logic implementation
  - `submitReport()` - Create new incident reports with validation
  - `getUserReports()` - Get user's reports with authorization
  - `getReportDetails()` - Get full report details with ownership check
  - `uploadEvidence()` - Handle evidence file uploads (stubbed for implementation)
  - `updateReportVisibility()` - Change report visibility settings
  - `getPublicReports()` - Get reports for admins/responders with role-based filtering

### 5. Controller Layer
- **`ReportController.java`** - REST API endpoints
  - `POST /api/report/submit` - Submit new incident reports
  - `GET /api/report/user-reports` - Get user's reports
  - `GET /api/report/details` - Get specific report details
  - `POST /api/report/upload-evidence` - Upload evidence files
  - `PUT /api/report/update-visibility` - Update report visibility
  - `GET /api/report/public-reports` - Get public reports (admin/responder only)

### 6. Testing & Documentation
- **`report_test.http`** - HTTP test file with sample requests
  - Tests for all endpoints with various scenarios
  - Error cases and validation testing
  - Authentication and authorization testing

- **`incident-report-module-impl.md`** - Complete API documentation
  - Detailed endpoint documentation matching provided format
  - Request/response examples for all operations
  - Error handling and status codes
  - Authorization levels and validation rules

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complete CRUD Operations
- ✅ Create incident reports with full validation
- ✅ Read user's own reports and specific report details
- ✅ Update report visibility settings
- ✅ Support for evidence upload (structure in place)

### 2. Security & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token validation for all endpoints
- ✅ User ownership verification for report access
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin/Responder for public reports)
- ✅ Proper error handling and HTTP status codes

### 3. Data Validation
- ✅ Input validation using Bean Validation annotations
- ✅ Incident type validation (harassment, theft, assault, other)
- ✅ Visibility validation (public, officials_only, private)
- ✅ Required field validation and data format checks

### 4. Business Logic
- ✅ Prevent duplicate reports for same alert
- ✅ Role-based filtering of public reports
- ✅ Truncated descriptions for report summaries
- ✅ Proper entity-to-DTO conversion methods

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error responses with meaningful messages
- ✅ JWT validation with proper unauthorized responses
- ✅ Database constraint handling
- ✅ Graceful exception handling in all layers

## Database Schema Compliance

The implementation fully complies with the provided incident_reports table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE incident_reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    alert_id UUID REFERENCES alerts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    incident_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    latitude NUMERIC(9,6) NOT NULL,
    longitude NUMERIC(9,6) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    incident_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    visibility TEXT NOT NULL,
    anonymous BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'submitted',
    action_taken TEXT,
    involved_parties JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (alert_id),
    CHECK (incident_type IN ('harassment', 'theft', 'assault', 'other')),
    CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'officials_only', 'private')),
    CHECK (status IN ('submitted', 'under_review', 'resolved'))
);
```

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth Required | Role Required |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| `/api/report/submit` | POST | Submit incident report | Yes | Any |
| `/api/report/user-reports` | GET | Get user's reports | Yes | Any |
| `/api/report/details` | GET | Get report details | Yes | Owner only |
| `/api/report/upload-evidence` | POST | Upload evidence | Yes | Owner only |
| `/api/report/update-visibility` | PUT | Update visibility | Yes | Owner only |
| `/api/report/public-reports` | GET | Get public reports | Yes | Admin/Responder |

## Future Enhancements Ready for Implementation

1. **Evidence File Handling**: File upload/storage logic is structured and ready for cloud storage integration
2. **Report Status Management**: Admin endpoints for updating report status (under_review, resolved)
3. **Geographical Queries**: Repository methods ready for heatmap and area-based reporting
4. **Notification Integration**: Can integrate with existing notification system for report updates
5. **Audit Trail**: Timestamp tracking is in place for change tracking

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test cases covering:
- ✅ Valid report submissions with all fields
- ✅ Validation error scenarios
- ✅ Authentication and authorization testing
- ✅ Edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Role-based access testing

All endpoints are ready for testing with the provided HTTP test file and can be integrated into the existing Spring Boot application immediately.
